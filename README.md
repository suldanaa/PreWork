Think of an app idea that you would like to build. 
It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. 
Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. 

Answer: 
I would love to create an app that promotes mindfulness through picture taking. 
I love taking pictures everyday and creating collages of them, and I also love the idea of a photo jounral.
So, my app would be going through your photos you took that day and prompting you about one thing you noticed that you can save for later.
Then, at the end of the year, you can look back and see all the tiny things you've captured and noticed through images.
I could also see how I could use a LLM to point out the most used words and it could be like a Spotify Replay for your photos.
I would also like to make it so you can have some customization of the images, such as stickers and such.
